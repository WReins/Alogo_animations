# Alogo_animations

SVG animations of the initial gifs in the prototype.
These are exports from the After Effects file. I used the Lottie library and bodymovin plugin for this.
The animations are exported as json files. The Lottie library parses and renders them.

I quickly set up the html/css/js to make it work in the browser.
